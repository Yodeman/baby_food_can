# BABY FOOD CAN INSPECTION SYSTEM

This project is my practice on the fundamentals of computer vision. The goal of this project is to build a system that inspects baby food can packaging pipeline and then detects if there are zero or more than one spoon in a package.

The system was implemented using template matching, and then used non-maximum suppression to filter the matching templates.
