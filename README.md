# BABY FOOD CAN INSPECTION SYSTEM

This project is my practice on the fundamentals of computer vision. The goal of this project is to build a system that scan baby food can packaging pipeline and then detects if there are zero or more than one spoon in the package.

The system was implemented using template matching, and then used non-maximum suppression to filter the matching templates.
